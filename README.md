# 546App

### Idea:

Not sure how many pages we will need. Currently for the overall functionally I am considering/suggest the following:

* Login/Signup

* Usernames - I am thinking allowing repeats and not checking what people wish to call themselves. Would be using a unqiue ID for each account. So basically the UID from firestore.

* Create a new question/post. 

* Answer/respond to a post/question. Which could allow for continuing threads/conversations.

* Perhaps a form of direct messages.

* Possibly following a user and seeing what they do and get updates about their activity.

* Allowing for images to be uploaded?

## Dependencies:
